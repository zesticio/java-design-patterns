# Design patterns implemented in Java
# Introduction
The greatest established methods a programmer may employ to address frequent issues when creating an application or system are design patterns.

By offering tried-and-true development paradigms, design patterns help hasten the development process.

For programmers and architects who are familiar with the patterns, reuse of design patterns helps prevent minor problems from becoming significant ones and also enhances the readability of the code.

Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:

1.  Design patterns are already defined and provide an industry-standard approach to solving a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern. There are many Java design patterns that we can use in our Java-based projects.
2.  Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to more robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
3.  Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new members of the team understand it easily.

# Getting Started
Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various Software Design Principles.

Java design patterns are divided into three categories
1.  Creational design patterns.
2.  Structural design patterns.
3.  Behavioral design patterns.

## Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns are concerned with the way of creating objects. These design patterns are used when a decision must be made at the time of instantiation of a class (i.e. creating an object of a class).

-   Singleton Pattern
-   Factory Pattern
-   Abstract Factory Pattern
-   Builder Pattern
-   Prototype Pattern

## Structural Design Pattern
Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

-   Adapter Pattern
-   Composite Pattern
-   Proxy Pattern
-   Flyweight Pattern
-   Facade Pattern
-   Bridge Pattern
-   Decorator Pattern

## Behavioral Design Pattern
Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects.
-   Template Method Pattern
-   Mediator Pattern
-   Chain of Responsibility Pattern
-   Observer Pattern
-   Strategy Pattern
-   Command Pattern
-   State Pattern
-   Visitor Pattern
-   Interpreter Pattern
-   Iterator Pattern
-   Memento Pattern

## Other Design Patterns
-   DAO Design Pattern
-   Dependency Injection Pattern
-   MVC Pattern
